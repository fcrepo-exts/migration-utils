# Migration Utilities [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fcrepo-exts/migration-utils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fcrepo-exts/migration-utils)

A framework to support migration of data from Fedora 3 to Fedora 6 repositories

## Overview

This utility iterates the foxml files of a fedora 2 or 3 repository, and creates a Fedora 6 compliant OCFL [Oxford Common File Layout](https://ocfl.io)

Migrations to Fedora 6 write migrated objects directly to the filesystem as [OCFL](https://ocfl.io/draft/spec/)
objects.  
In particular:

* There is a 1:1 correspondence between Fedora 3 objects and OCFL objects.  Fedora 3 datastreams appear as files within the resulting OCFL objects.
* RDF is not re-mapped, `info:fedora/` subjects and objects are kept intact as-is
* FOXML object and datastream properties are represented as triples in additional sidecar files

## Status

Fedora 6 support is being actively developed, and is considered unstable until Fedora 6 is released.

## How to use

Background work

* Determine the disposition of your FOXML files:
  * Will you be migrating from exported (archive or migration context) FOXML?
    * If so, you will need all of the export FOXML in a known directory.
  * Will you be migrating from from a native fcrepo3 filesystem?
    * If so, fcrepo3 should not be running, and you will need to determine if you're using legacy or akubra storage

General usage of the migration utils CLI is as follows:

```java -jar target/migration-utils-6.0.0-SNAPSHOT-driver.jar [various options | --help]```

*Note that the migration utility will only run under Java 11+.*  

The following CLI options for specifying details of a given migration are available:
```

### PID migration selection

The default migration configuration will migrate all of the Fedora 2/3 objects found in the source. Subsequent runs will simply re-migrate all of those objects.
However, there are circumstances when it is preferred that only a subset of all source objects be migrated.
There are three means by which a subset of objects may be selected for migration (noting that these means may also be combined).
* *Limit*: When setting the `limit` configuration (detailed above), the migration will be performed on first X-number of objects specified by the value of `limit`.
* *PID List*: When a pid-list is provided (detailed above), the migration will only be performed on the objects associated with the PIDs in the provided pid-list file.
* *Resume*: When enabling the `resume` configuration (detailed above), a file is maintained that keeps track of the last successfully migration object. Subsequent executions will only migrate objects following the last migrated object. Note, this capability is based on the assumption that the order of objects to be migrated is deterministic and the same from one execution to the next.


### Examples

Run a minimal fedora 6 migration from fedora3 legacy foxml

```shell
java -jar target/migration-utils-6.0.0-SNAPSHOT-driver.jar --source-type=legacy --limit=100 --target-dir=target/test/ocfl --objects-dir=src/test/resources/legacyFS/objects --datastreams-dir=src/test/resources/legacyFS/datastreams
```
Run a minimal fedora 6 migration from a fedora3 archival export
```shell
java -jar target/migration-utils-6.0.0-SNAPSHOT-driver.jar --source-type=exported --limit=100 --target-dir=target/test/ocfl --exported-dir=src/test/resources/exported

```

† The `fedora3model` namespace is not a published namespace. It is a representation of the fcrepo 3 namespace `info:fedora/fedora-system:def/model`.

‡ Not yet implemented

**Note**: All fcrepo 3 DC (Dublin Core) datastream values are mapped as dcterms properties on the Object in fcrepo 6+. The same goes for any properties in the RELS-EXT and RELS-INT datastreams.
