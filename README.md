# Migration Utilities [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils)

A framework to support migration of data from Fedora 3 to Fedora 4 repositories.

## Overview

The main class (`org.fcrepo.migration.Migrator`) iterates over all of the fedora objects in a configured source (`org.fcrepo.migration.ObjectSource`) and handles them using the configured handler (`org.fcrepo.migration.StreamingFedoraObjectHandler`). The configuration is entirely contained within a Spring XML configuration file in [`src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml`](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml).

## Status

A basic migration scenario is implemented that may serve as a starting point for
your own migration from Fedora 3.x to Fedora 4.x.

## How to use

Background work

* Determine the disposition of your FOXML files:
  * Will you be migrating from exported (archive or migration context) FOXML?
    * If so, you will need all of the export FOXML in a known directory.
  * Will you be migrating from from a native fcrepo3 filesystem?
    * If so, fcrepo3 should not be running, and you will need to determine if you're using legacy or akubra storage
* Determine your fcrepo4 url (ex: http://localhost:8080/rest/, http://yourHostName.ca:8080/fcrepo/rest/) ([line 155](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml#L155))
* There is currently only one implemented pid-mapping strategy, but you can configure it to put all of your migrated content under a given path ([line 94](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml#L94), sets that value to "migrated-fedora3").

Getting started:
* [Download](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/releases) the executable jar file
* Create a local copy of the example [configuration file](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml) and update as described below:
  * If you are migrating from exported FOXML, you will leave [line 9](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml#L9).
  * If you are migrating from a native fcrepo3 file system, you will need to change `exportedFoxmlDirectoryObjectSource` to `nativeFoxmlDirectoryObjectSource` in [line 9](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml#L9).
  * If you are migrating from a native fcrepo3 file system, you will need to set the paths to the `objectStore` and `datastreamStore` ([Lines 158-164](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml#L158-L164)).
  * If you are migrating from exported FOXML, you will need to set the path to the directory you have them stored in ([Lines 166-169](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml#L166-L168)).
  * Set your fcrepo4 url ([Line 155](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml#L155)).
  * If you would like to run the migration in test mode (console logging), you will leave [lines 11-16](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml#L11-L16) as is.
  * If you would like to run the migration, you will need to comment out or remove [line 9](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml#L11), and uncomment [line 15](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml#L15).
  * To set what namespace prefixes get declared, provide a properties file like [this](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/namespaces.properties), and set the path to it at [line 185](https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/migration-utils/blob/master/src/main/resources/spring/migration-bean.xml#L185).


To run the migration scenario you have configured in the Spring XML configuration file:

```
java -jar migration-utils-{version}-driver.jar <relative-or-absolute-path-to-configuration-file>
```

† The `fedora3model` namespace is not a published namespace. It is a representation of the fcrepo3 namespace `info:fedora/fedora-system:def/model`.

‡ Not yet implemented

**Note**: All fcrepo3 DC (Dublin Core) datastream values are mapped as dcterms properties on the Object in fcrepo4. The same goes for any properties in the RELS-EXT and RELS-INT datastreams.
